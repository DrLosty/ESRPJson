    "menuGuide": "Classes in games are essentially predefined roles that define how a character interacts with the world, engages in combat, and supports or challenges others. Each class typically offers a unique set of abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, allowing players to choose a playstyle that matches their preferences.\n\nClasses determine what a character can doâ€”whether it's dealing damage, healing, controlling the environment, or providing support. In many games, classes can be tailored or evolved as characters progress, giving players room for customization.\n\nAt their core, classes help balance gameplay by ensuring that different types of characters can interact with each other in complementary ways. Whether you prefer upfront combat, stealth, magic, or healing, the diversity of classes ensures that every player can find a role that suits them, whether playing solo or as part of a team.",
