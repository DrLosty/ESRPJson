      "Common folk trained with spear and shield, they form the backbone of any levy, fighting not for glory but for survival and duty.",
      "Toilers of soil, keepers of hearths and livestock, serfs feed the realm and breed its beasts, the lifeblood of every holdfast.",
      "Forged in fire and sweat, blacksmiths are the silent crafters of war—makers of blades, armor, and the fate of kings.",
      "Wielders of rope and raw meat, tamers bend the wild to their will, commanding beasts as allies in hunt and war.",
      "With steady hands and ancient herbs, healers mend the broken, serving smallfolk and lords alike beneath the ever-turning wheel of pain and mercy.",
      "Quick of hand and fleet of foot, thieves slip through shadows and locked doors alike, thriving in chaos and coin.",
      "Chosen few who walk among fire and scale, they are guardians of the realm’s greatest power—beasts born of Valyria.",
      "Sworn to knowledge and bound in chain, maesters counsel lords, heal wounds, and keep the realm's secrets hidden in parchment and ink."
